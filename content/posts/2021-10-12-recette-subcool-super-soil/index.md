>**Mix Ingredients Together, Then What ?**

 No, Subcool’s super soil isn’t ready to use quite yet. Next you want to “cook ” this mix. No you’re not going to put in the oven you are going to re-bag the soil ( put it back into the bag the base soil came out of) or put it into some other suitable container such as a garbage can. Once into the storage container you want to water the mix lightly and mix until all the soil is moist but not wet. You want the soil mix moist to activate the mycorrhizae ( microbial activity) and begin dissolving the powdered ingredients. Don’t forget to close your bags and put a lid on the garbage can. You want the containers closed to trap the heat in. Just like a compost it will create its own heat. Now you want to put your container somewhere where it can sit in the sun most of the day and“cook”. You want this organic soil mix to “cook” for at least a month.

>**Cook Mix In The Sun ?**

Yes you want this organic mix to bake in the sun just like you would a compost. In fact that is what you just mixed a Super Organic Soil Compost ! Because whole ingredients like, bone meal, blood meal, rock phosphate, azomite, and the bat guano, need to break down, you want it to compost (cook). You do this so these ingredients begin to break down into usable water-soluble particles that will then be available to your medical marijuana plants.

Mycorrhizae, one tablespoon of Magnesium Sulfate(Epsom salts), one teaspoon of powdered Humic Acid, and a quarter of a teaspoon of Azomite. By watering the first time using these ingredients, it seems to jump-start the biological process driven by the mycorrhizae micro-organisms which in turn allows the natural production of available nutrients in the soil. These measurements are for a 7 gallon pot. I have used this method on hundreds of plants with excellent results. I must reiterate ; Cooking of the soil is the preferred method !

>**Not For Seedlings Or Clones !**

This organic soil mix is not intended to plant seed in, nor is it for cuttings, or for your newly rooted clones. This soil mix is too hot ( too many available nutrients) for young plants roots. This soil mix is also too hot to use by itself.

For Bottom 1/3 of Pot ! This mix is so strong that it should be in the bottom 1/3 of the pot for most varieties of medical marijuana. There are a few varieties that will want more of this super soil, up to 1/2 of the pot. The rest of the pot fill with just the organic base soil like “Roots Organics Soil”.

>**Pot Size ?**

The best pot size is debatable, but I have found that a 7 gallon pot is **7 gallon pot** adequate and what I use the most. I also like to grow in a 10 gallon pot for a large growing space. I have grown successfully in 3 gallon and 5 gallon pots also. The SOG (sea of green) method uses 1 gallon pots. I would not use this super soil in any pot smaller than 5 gallons.

>**Good For The Whole Crop Cycle !**

With Subcool’s super soil there will be no need to fertilize ever ! Everything your growing organic marijuana wants from vegetating through flowering to harvest, is in this super organic mix. What more could your organic medical marijuana want ? All you have to do is water ! How simple is that ?
