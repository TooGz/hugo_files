**Important Notes**

The track limit’s shown are only approximate, the actual limit will depend on your iTunes library and the amount of meta-data stored within (e.g. artist name, track name, genre, comments, album art, etc, etc).

The track limits are a function of the iTunes database size and the memory (RAM) on the iPod motherboard, it is not a limitation of the iFlash adapters.

Feedback from users, the limit range for the 30Gb model iPods can be anywhere from 10000 tracks to 30000 tracks.

Reports for other (60Gb/80Gb/160Gb) iPods limits can range from 30000 tracks to 60000 tracks.

The 6th Gen models (80Gb/120Gb/Thick 160Gb) are limited to LBA28 addressing by Apple, so these models will only show and use up to 128Gb of the storage installed – The other iPod models have LBA48 addressing so do not have this limitation.

This LBA28 Limitation can be removed by replacing the iPod operating system with an 3rd party OS. Please note we DO NOT support these types of installations – the iFlash boards are designed and only tested to work with the original Apple iPod OS and iTunes / Apple iPod Music software.

The 6th Gen 160Gb (Thick) model will require a replacement HDD Ribbon as the original hard drive uses an CE-ATA interface, replacement Ribbons can be purchased here.
